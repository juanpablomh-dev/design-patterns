## Definition

> The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. 
  By doing so, the same construction process can create different representations.
## Example used

Imagine that you have to create different types of SubWay sandwiches.
Creating a construct for each type would be inelegant and it would also be very difficult 
to know the order of the parameters.

With the builder, I was able to create the base structure of the sandwich and add the components I want.

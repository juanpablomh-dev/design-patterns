## Definition

> An adapter allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is the real-world definition for an adapter. Interfaces may be incompatible, but the inner functionality should suit the need. The adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.
## Usage

> An adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. Alternatively, a decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time, and a facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired.[4] 

## Example used

Imagine a cyclist who only knows how to "pedal" a conventional bicycle but does not know how to "accelerate" to drive an electric bicycle.
